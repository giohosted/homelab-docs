## Overview

Immich is the self-hosted photo and video library for homelab-v3. It replaces Google Photos as the primary photo backup and browsing solution. Immich runs on a dedicated VM (immich-prod-01) on pve-prod-02 — isolated from the media stack to contain ML worker CPU spikes during face detection and CLIP indexing.

Photo files live on the NAS (`/mnt/user/photos`) and are NFS-mounted into the VM at `/data/photos`. The Postgres database lives on the VM's local disk — NFS is not supported for Postgres.

## Network & Routing

Immich is on a dedicated VM — Traefik on docker-prod-01 routes via the file provider:

- **Traefik static route:** `photos.giohosted.com` → `http://192.168.30.14:2283`
- **Config file:** `/opt/appdata/traefik/config/immich.yml` on docker-prod-01
- **AdGuard DNS rewrite:** `photos.giohosted.com` → `192.168.30.11` (Traefik IP)
- **Port 2283** exposed on host via ports mapping — required for cross-host file provider routing

Traffic path:
```
Browser → AdGuard (192.168.30.10) → 192.168.30.11 (Traefik) → 192.168.30.14:2283 (immich_server)
```

## External Access

- **CF Tunnel:** Deferred to Phase 5
- **CF Access:** Deferred to Phase 5
- Currently accessible on LAN only at `https://photos.giohosted.com`

## Storage

### NFS Mount

| NAS Export | Mount Point | Purpose |
|------------|-------------|---------|
| `192.168.30.16:/mnt/user/photos` | `/data/photos` | All Immich upload data — photos, thumbs, backups, encoded video |

fstab entry:
```
192.168.30.16:/mnt/user/photos /data/photos nfs defaults,_netdev,x-systemd.automount,x-systemd.mount-timeout=30 0 0
```

### Volumes

| Host Path | Container Path | Purpose |
|-----------|---------------|---------|
| `/data/photos` | `/data` | Upload location — photos, thumbs, backups, encoded video |
| `/opt/appdata/immich/postgres` | `/var/lib/postgresql/data` | Postgres database — local disk only, NFS not supported |

### Immich Upload Folder Structure

Immich manages its own folder structure inside `/data/photos` (= `/mnt/user/photos` on NAS):
```
/data/photos/
├── backups/          ← Immich auto-generated DB backups (nightly)
├── encoded-video/    ← Transcoded video versions
├── library/          ← External library assets (if used)
├── profile/          ← User profile photos
├── thumbs/           ← Generated thumbnails
└── upload/           ← User uploaded photos and videos (organized by user UUID)
```

> **Important:** Immich DB auto-backups are stored at `/data/photos/backups/` — these are the authoritative backup source for the Immich database. They are on the NAS ZFS mirror pool and are retained automatically by Immich (last 7 days by default).

---

## Environment Variables (.env)

| Variable | Value | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| `UPLOAD_LOCATION` | `/data/photos` | NFS mount point on host |
| `DB_DATA_LOCATION` | `/opt/appdata/immich/postgres` | Local disk — never NFS |
| `TZ` | `America/Chicago` | Timezone |
| `IMMICH_VERSION` | `release` | Always pulls latest stable |
| `DB_PASSWORD` | see `.env` | Gitignored — never commit |
| `DB_USERNAME` | `postgres` | Postgres user |
| `DB_DATABASE_NAME` | `immich` | Postgres database name |

---

## Authentication

- **Method:** OAuth via Authentik — carried forward from v2 backup
- **Authentik application:** `Immich`
- **Authentik provider:** Carried forward from v2 — all users and sessions intact on restore
- **Local admin:** Retained as break-glass — do not delete
- **OIDC for Phase 5:** Full OIDC configuration review deferred to Phase 5

## v2 → v3 Migration

Immich was restored using Immich's own auto-generated database backups rather than a manual appdata backup (the v2 appdata backup folder was empty).

### Restore Process

1. Deployed fresh Immich stack — containers came up healthy
2. Immich entered maintenance mode on first boot — no database schema present
3. Navigated to maintenance URL from server logs: `https://photos.giohosted.com/maintenance?token=<token>`
4. Cancelled the restore wizard (no backup to upload via UI) — created fresh admin user
5. Found Immich auto-generated DB backups at `/data/photos/backups/` — 14 days of backups present
6. Restored most recent backup (2026-03-10) directly via psql:
```bash
gunzip -c /data/photos/backups/immich-db-backup-20260310T020000-v2.5.6-pg14.19.sql.gz | docker exec -i immich_postgres psql -U postgres -d immich
```
7. Asset paths in database were stored as `/data/upload/...` — matched the official compose volume mapping (`:/data`). Photos loaded correctly after restart.
8. Thumbnail regeneration queued via Administration → Job Queues → Generate Thumbnails → All (~7,400 assets)
9. OAuth login working — user "Gio" authenticated via Authentik

### Issues Encountered

| Issue | Resolution |
|-------|------------|
| Immich maintenance mode on first boot | Fresh DB had no schema. Bypassed by navigating to maintenance URL from server logs, cancelling restore wizard, creating admin user. |
| UI restore failed silently | Immich maintenance mode UI restore was interrupted mid-migration, leaving empty tables. Fixed by running restore directly via psql CLI. |
| Port 2283 not accessible from Traefik | Immich compose had no ports mapping — required for cross-host file provider routing. Added `ports: - "2283:2283"` to immich-server. |
| nas-isos NFS broken on pve-prod-02 | nas-isos storage entry used DAC link IP (10.0.0.2) unreachable from pve-prod-02. Fixed by adding separate `nas-isos-p2` storage entry scoped to pve-prod-02 using 192.168.30.16. |
| docker-prod-01 RAM pressure | docker-prod-01 had 1GB active swap. Bumped from 6GB to 8GB before creating immich-prod-01 VM. |
| Non-standard compose volume path | Initially used `/usr/src/app/upload` as internal mount path — caused confusion during path troubleshooting. Corrected to official `:/data` mapping. |

---

## Job Queues

After a fresh DB restore, run these jobs in order to fully re-index the library:

1. **Extract Metadata** → All
2. **Generate Thumbnails** → All
3. **Smart Search** → All (CLIP indexing — runs on ML worker)
4. **Face Detection** → Missing (runs on ML worker — slow on first run)
5. **Facial Recognition** → Missing (runs after face detection)

> ML jobs (Smart Search, Face Detection) run on the `immich_machine_learning` container and are CPU-heavy on first run. On a 2-core VM they will take several hours for a large library. This is expected — they run in the background and don't affect photo browsing.

---

## Database Backups

Immich automatically backs up its database nightly to `/data/photos/backups/` (= `/mnt/user/photos/backups/` on NAS). These are retained for 7 days by default.

These backups are on the NAS ZFS mirror pool — protected by ZFS redundancy and ZnapZend snapshots.

**To restore from an Immich auto-backup:**
```bash
# Stop the server to prevent writes during restore
docker stop immich_server

# Restore the backup
gunzip -c /data/photos/backups/<backup-filename>.sql.gz | docker exec -i immich_postgres psql -U postgres -d immich

# Start the server
docker start immich_server
```

> Always use the psql CLI method — the Immich UI restore is unreliable and can fail silently mid-migration.

## Directory Structure
```
/opt/stacks/immich/
  compose.yaml              ← in git
  .env                      ← gitignored (DB_PASSWORD and other secrets)

/opt/appdata/immich/
  postgres/                 ← Postgres data — local disk, never backed up via rsync
                               (Immich auto-backups to NAS are the DB backup source)

/data/photos/               ← NFS mount from nas-prod-01:/mnt/user/photos
  backups/                  ← Immich auto-generated DB backups
  encoded-video/
  library/
  profile/
  thumbs/
  upload/                   ← Photo and video files by user UUID

## Traefik File Provider Config

`/opt/appdata/traefik/config/immich.yml` on docker-prod-01:
```yaml
http:
  routers:
    immich:
      rule: "Host(`photos.giohosted.com`)"
      entrypoints:
        - websecure
      tls:
        certResolver: cloudflare
      service: immich

  services:
    immich:
      loadBalancer:
        servers:
          - url: "http://192.168.30.14:2283"
```

## Design Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Dedicated VM on pve-prod-02 | ML worker CPU spikes isolated from media stack. pve-prod-02 had ample RAM headroom. See `architecture/decisions-log.md`. |
| Postgres on local VM disk | Immich explicitly does not support NFS for Postgres. Local disk avoids NFS latency and locking issues. |
| DB restore via psql CLI | UI restore failed silently mid-migration. CLI restore is reliable and provides clear output. |
| Official compose volume mapping `:/data` | Non-standard paths cause DB asset path mismatches on future migrations. Official mapping ensures consistency with Immich tooling. |
| CF Tunnel deferred to Phase 5 | Internal access working. External access and CF Access policy configuration deferred alongside other Phase 5 hardening tasks. |

- QEMU guest agent installed — Proxmox can cleanly shut down this VM on UPS event
- NUT client not yet configured — to be done in Phase 5
- `gio` user added to `service` group (GID 2000) on immich-prod-01 for file permission consistency
- git identity configured: `delgadogiovanny@gmail.com` / `giohosted`
- Phase 5 TODO: CF Tunnel + CF Access for `photos.giohosted.com`
- Phase 5 TODO: NUT client configuration
- Phase 5 TODO: Full OIDC review and Authentik provider audit
